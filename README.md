# coordinates-visualization

This is a simple page to visualize radial coordinates of primary numbers in specified range.

So, it takes range of primary numbers from 1 to specified by user number and draws every primary number as dot on canvas.

- The X coordinate - calculated as `x*cos(x)` 
- The Y coordinate - calculated as `x*sin(x)`

Where `x` - is primary number 

You can check how it looks like here [coordinate-visualization](https://integervector.github.io/coordinates-visualization/)
